# Development Guide

This guide outlines the development workflow for the JSON Calendar TypeScript implementation.

## Getting Started
1. The main implementation is in [src/index.ts](mdc:src/index.ts)
2. TypeScript configuration is managed in [tsconfig.json](mdc:tsconfig.json)
3. Dependencies and scripts are defined in [package.json](mdc:package.json)

## Implementation Guidelines
- Follow TypeScript best practices for type safety
- Ensure compliance with JSON Calendar 1.0 specification
- Validate changes against test cases in [spec/1.0.json](mdc:spec/1.0.json)

## Building and Testing
- Use npm scripts defined in [package.json](mdc:package.json) for building and testing
- Ensure all specification test cases pass before submitting changes
